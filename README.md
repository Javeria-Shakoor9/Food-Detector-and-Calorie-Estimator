# Food Detection and Calorie Estimation

## Overview

The **Food Detection and Calorie Estimation** project leverages advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to identify food items in images and estimate their caloric values. Utilizing the YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once) model, this system provides an efficient and accurate solution for dietary monitoring and nutritional analysis, making it a valuable resource for health-conscious individuals and nutritionists.

## Features

- **Real-Time Food Detection**: Employs the YOLOv4 model for rapid identification of multiple food items within images.
- **Caloric Estimation**: Accurately estimates the caloric content of detected food items using an extensive nutritional database.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable database to accommodate additional food items and nutritional information.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides clear output of detected food items alongside their respective caloric values.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Implements ML algorithms for enhanced food recognition capabilities.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes the YOLOv4 model, known for its superior performance in object detection tasks.
- **Computer Vision**: Leverages OpenCV for advanced image processing techniques.
- **Programming Language**: Developed in Python, ensuring compatibility with a range of ML and DL libraries.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: 
  - `TensorFlow` for model implementation
  - `Keras` for deep learning operations
